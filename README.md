This project is distributed across 2 repositories

## What Is This 
My village was conducting a football tournament. So i decided to make a real time score updating system for it. It was a fun project to develop my skills.
It was my **first project** in web btw . 
I cant afford to buy a server or something to make this project available to public ðŸ˜….

So i choosed Google-Firebase ðŸ”¥
Actually i love backend coding but i cant do it in this situation
